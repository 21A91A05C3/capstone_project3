                A food court is a common area within a shopping mall, airport, office building, or other public spaces where multiple food vendors or restaurants set up small, individual food stalls or kiosks. The primary purpose of a food court is to provide a variety of dining options to cater to a diverse range of tastes and preferences in a convenient and centralized location.
                Here are some key characteristics and features of food courts:<br/><br/>

                1.Variety of Food Choices: Food courts typically offer a wide range of cuisines and food options, including fast food, international cuisine, local specialties, and more. This diversity is intended to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers.
                <br/><br/>
                2.Convenience: Food courts are designed for quick and efficient service, making them a convenient choice for people looking to grab a meal or snack while shopping or traveling. Customers can choose from various options and often get their food relatively quickly.
                <br/><br/>
                3.Seating Areas: Food courts usually have ample seating areas with tables and chairs, allowing customers to sit down and enjoy their meals. The seating areas are often designed to accommodate large groups and families.
                <br/><br/>
                4.Self-Service: In most food courts, customers place their orders at the individual stalls or counters, pay at the respective registers, and then collect their food. It's a self-service model where patrons typically clear their own tables and dispose of their trash in designated receptacles.
                <br/><br/>
                5.Atmosphere: Food courts may have a casual and informal atmosphere, often with a communal or shared dining experience. Some food courts may also feature decorative elements or themes to enhance the ambiance.
                <br/><br/>
                6.Price Range: Food court offerings can vary widely in terms of price. While some vendors offer budget-friendly options, others may provide more upscale or gourmet choices.
                <br/><br/>
                7.Tenant Rotation: In some cases, food court tenants may change periodically to introduce new dining options and keep the food court fresh and exciting.
                <br/><br/>
                8.Special Events: Food courts may host special events, promotions, or themed nights to attract customers and create a vibrant atmosphere.
